      <h2>These changes <span>(and many more!)</span> are possible, but not through dieting.  The Self-Regulated Eater offers a sustainable, psychology-driven strategy that frees you from emotional eating, food restrictions, and feelings of deprivation.</h2>
      <h3>The authors, a mother-and-daughter team of psychology experts, guide you on a deeply introspective journey as you transition from the external control of a diet mindset to internal regulation.  Your struggles will be validated and your triumphs celebrated as you forever change your relationship with food, eating, and yourself.  It is time to make your efforts last. It is time for self-regulated eating.</h3>

      <h2>What Does It Mean to Trust My Body and Myself?</h2>
      <p>Trusting your body means learning to recognize and respond to your internal cues for hunger, fulness, and satisfaction. People often say, “eat when you’re hungry and stop when you’re full” but that’s not so simple. Especially if you are a chronic dieter and have lost your connection with your physical eating cues. You may not be fully aware of the thoughts and feelings that trigger eating decisions and lead to emotional eating or bingeing. For example, what if you recognize you’re physically full, but still continue to eat past the point of fullness? You’ll build up the strength of your body’s signals so you can actually listen and depend on them. And when you trust yourself to make eating choices that honor your unique needs, you will unlock the key to lasting change.</p>

      <h2>What Does It Mean to Transform My Eating?</h2>
      <p>As you become a self-regulated eater, your food preferences will change. Contrary to your fears, your body will tell you it wants a wide variety of foods --not just food high in fat, carbs, or addedsugars. Your physical eating signals will reignite, and you will start to feel the sensations of satisfaction, fullness, and hunger spontaneously. You will notice you are eating less food as you stop eating when you are full, and eating only when you’re hungry and foods that are satisfying to you. You will also experience fewer episodes of emotional eating and bingeing. You will not feel deprived or restricted because you can choose foods that are satisfying to you, including previously forbidden ones, and not feel guilty. Gone is the need to rebel!</p>
